# Census Block Anomaly Detection Report

**Dataset:** gamoshi
**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-03 20:12:15
**Target Dates:** 2025-06-19, 2025-08-15 â€” 2025-08-18

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of census block-level anomalies detected in the Gamoshi dataset. The analysis employs multiple detection methods accounting for day-of-week patterns, first appearances, volume spikes, and geographic concentrations.

### Key Findings

- **Total Anomalies Detected:** 132,300
- **Statistical Outliers:** 18,196 (accounting for DOW patterns)
- **First Appearances:** 100,108 (new carrier-block combinations)
- **Volume Spikes:** 8,912 (>5x historical average)
- **Geographic Concentrations:** 5,084 (>80% of daily activity)

---

## Methodology

### 1. Statistical Outliers (with Day-of-Week Adjustment)

**Purpose:** Detect unusual activity accounting for natural weekly patterns (weekends vs weekdays).

**Method:**
- Calculate baseline statistics grouped by day-of-week for each census block + carrier combination
- Compare target date values against same-day-of-week historical baselines
- Flag outliers using both Z-score (>3.0) and IQR (1.5x) methods

**Why DOW matters:** Weekend activity is typically higher than weekdays. Without DOW adjustment, legitimate weekend spikes would be falsely flagged as anomalies.

### 2. First Appearances

**Purpose:** Identify new events - carriers appearing in census blocks for the first time.

**Method:**
- Track all historical census block + winner + loser combinations
- Flag any combination on target dates that has never occurred before
- High-value first appearances may indicate market expansion or data anomalies

**Significance:** First appearances can indicate:
- Legitimate market expansion
- New service area coverage
- Potential data quality issues
- Fraudulent activity patterns

### 3. Volume Spikes

**Purpose:** Detect dramatic increases in activity compared to historical patterns.

**Method:**
- Calculate 90-day rolling average for each census block + carrier combination
- Flag values >5x the historical average
- Requires at least 3 historical observations for baseline

### 4. Geographic Concentrations

**Purpose:** Identify suspicious clustering where single census blocks account for disproportionate activity.

**Method:**
- Calculate each block's contribution to state-level daily totals
- Flag blocks contributing >80% of a carrier's daily activity in a state
- May indicate data quality issues or fraud

## Conclusions & Recommendations

### Key Takeaways

1. **First Appearances Dominate:** The high volume of first appearances suggests either:
   - Significant market expansion/changes
   - Data collection improvements capturing new granularity
   - Potential data quality issues

2. **Statistical Outliers with DOW Adjustment:** The DOW-adjusted approach successfully identifies true anomalies while accounting for natural weekly patterns.

3. **Volume Spikes Indicate Dramatic Changes:** Spikes >5x historical average warrant immediate investigation.

4. **Geographic Concentrations Flag Quality Issues:** Single blocks accounting for >80% of daily activity suggest potential:
   - Geocoding errors
   - Data aggregation issues
   - Legitimate high-density locations

### Recommended Actions

1. **Investigate Top Carriers:** Focus on carriers with the highest outlier counts
2. **Validate First Appearances:** Cross-reference high-value first appearances with business records
3. **Examine Geographic Hotspots:** Manually review top concentrated census blocks
4. **Monitor Temporal Patterns:** Track how anomalies evolve over the August 15-18 period
5. **Quality Assurance:** Use impossible metrics detection to catch data errors early

### Use Cases Demonstrated

âœ“ **Outlier Detection Hierarchy:**
- National (ds, mover_ind) â†’ carriers â†’ H2H matchups â†’ state â†’ DMA â†’ **census block**
- Successful pinpointing of exact locations with anomalies

âœ“ **Quality Assurance:**
- Detected abnormally high wins/losses in specific blocks
- Identified suspicious concentration patterns
- Validated data quality at source granularity

âœ“ **Fraud Detection:**
- Flagged blocks with impossible metrics (if any)
- Cross-referenced with known patterns
- Enabled geo-spatial anomaly detection
