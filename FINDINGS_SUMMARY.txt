DMA CENSUS BLOCK DRILL-DOWN ANALYSIS - KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-03
Dataset: Gamoshi

================================================================================
QUESTION 1: How many new census blocks appear over time?
================================================================================

Starting from 30 days into the data to establish baseline:

MOVERS:
  - Average: 15,507 new census block+carrier combos per day
  - Median:  14,150 per day
  - Max:     42,576 in a single day
  - 60.47% of all daily combinations are NEW
  - 60.04% of daily volume comes from NEW combinations

NON-MOVERS:
  - Average: 5,497 new combos per day
  - Median:  5,025 per day
  - Max:     12,768 in a single day
  - 55.71% of all daily combinations are NEW
  - 53.82% of daily volume comes from NEW combinations

INTERPRETATION:
The high rate of new combinations suggests:
  • Market expansion (carriers entering new areas)
  • Data quality improvements (better geocoding)
  • Large, sparse census block + carrier space
  • Potential anomalies/errors in new data

================================================================================
QUESTION 2: How to do deterministic drill-down suppression?
================================================================================

OLD APPROACH (Current):
  Level: (date, ds, mover_ind, dma, winner, loser)
  Problem: Suppress ALL records for the entire combination
  Result: 0% data retention for affected groups

NEW APPROACH (Census Block):
  Level: (date, ds, mover_ind, dma, census_block, winner, loser)
  Benefit: Suppress ONLY problematic census blocks
  Result: 37.48% overall data retention!

REAL NUMBERS (2025-08-16):
  • Total census blocks: 14,524
  • Blocks to suppress:   9,080
  • Blocks preserved:     5,444 (37.48%)
  • DMAs affected:        325

EXAMPLE - LOS ANGELES DMA:
  • Total census blocks: 591
  • Suppress: 275 (46.5%)
  • PRESERVE: 316 (53.47%) ← This data would be LOST with old approach!

SUPPRESSION REASONS:
  1. Statistical Outliers (DOW-adjusted): 593 records
     → Values >3σ from same-day-of-week baseline
  
  2. Volume Spikes: 2,821 records
     → Values >5x their 90-day average
  
  3. Geographic Concentrations: 29,468 records
     → Single block accounts for >80% of state daily activity
  
  4. First Appearances: 66,232 records
     → New census_block + winner + loser combination

  Total unique records to suppress: 82,456
  (Some flagged for multiple reasons)

================================================================================
QUESTION 3: What are the recommended next steps?
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (This Sprint):
  1. Validate suppression list (review top 100 manually)
  2. Implement surgical suppression pipeline
     → Create suppression_list table in duck_suppression.db
  3. Test on historical data
  4. Measure data retention improvement

MEDIUM-TERM (Next Month):
  5. Automate daily suppression detection
  6. Add 'Data Quality' dashboard tab
  7. Build suppression feedback loop (track false positives)

LONG-TERM (Next Quarter):
  8. Machine learning for suppression prediction
  9. Root cause analysis with data providers
  10. Carrier-level data quality scorecard

================================================================================
THE BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

BEFORE (Old Approach):
  ❌ Suppress entire DMA combinations
  ❌ Lose 100% of data for affected groups
  ❌ Overly aggressive, destroys good data

AFTER (Census Block Approach):
  ✅ Suppress only problematic census blocks
  ✅ Preserve 37.5% of data
  ✅ Surgical precision maintains quality without sacrificing coverage

SAVINGS EXAMPLE:
  Los Angeles:     Save 316 blocks (53% retained)
  Sacramento:      Save 97 blocks (57% retained)
  Chicago:         Save 164 blocks (45% retained)
  Tampa:           Save 155 blocks (49% retained)
  Nationwide:      Save 5,444 blocks (37.5% retained)

================================================================================
DECISION POINT
================================================================================

Do we move forward with implementing surgical census block suppression?

If YES:
  • Expected benefit: Preserve 30-50% more data vs current approach
  • Implementation time: 1-2 sprints
  • Risk: Low (can test on historical data first)
  • Upside: Significantly improved product quality + data coverage

If NO:
  • Continue with current DMA-level suppression
  • Accept 100% data loss for affected combinations
  • Miss opportunity for surgical precision
