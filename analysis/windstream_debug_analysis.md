# Windstream Suppression Debug Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Dataset:** gamoshi (non-mover)
**Window:** June 1 - August 31, 2025

## Problem Statement

Windstream had **8 national outlier dates** totaling **437 wins to remove**, but the suppression tool only removed **37 wins** (~8.5% of needed removals).

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
The suppression algorithm has two stages:
1. **Auto Suppression**: Remove outlier pairs (z-score violations, first appearances, rare pairs)
2. **Distributed Suppression**: Proportionally distribute remaining excess across eligible pairs

The problem: **Auto suppression had a hardcoded 5-win minimum threshold** that was too high for Windstream's pair distribution.

### Windstream's Pair Distribution

Windstream operates differently than large carriers like AT&T or Verizon:
- Many small DMA markets (1-2 wins per pair)
- Few concentrated markets
- National outliers arise from **cumulative small spikes** across many pairs

**Example: 2025-06-11**
- National wins: 39 (baseline: 29.5)
- Excess to remove: 10 wins
- Total DMA pairs: 57
- **Pairs with 5+ wins: 0** ❌
- Pairs with 1+ wins: 29 (39 total wins available) ✅

### Why Hardcoded 5-Win Minimum Failed

For **2025-06-11** (need to remove 10 wins):

**Step 1: Auto Suppression**
- Pairs meeting auto criteria (outliers/first appearance): 26 pairs
- After 5-win filter: **0 pairs** ❌
- Auto removed: 0 wins

**Step 2: Distribution**
- Remaining need: 10 wins
- Eligible pairs (>= 1 win): 29 pairs (39 wins available)
- Should have distributed proportionally: ~10 wins

**But with distributed_min_wins = 5:**
- Eligible pairs (>= 5 wins): **0 pairs** ❌
- Result: Nothing removed!

## The Fix

### Changes Made

1. **Added configurable slider**: "Min Wins for Auto Suppression"
   - Default: 2 wins (was hardcoded at 5)
   - Range: 1-20 wins
   - Users can now adjust based on carrier characteristics

2. **Lowered distribution minimum default**: 
   - From 2 → 1 win
   - Ensures distributed suppression can always run if pairs exist

### Code Changes

```python
# Before
auto_candidates = auto_candidates[auto_candidates['pair_wins_current'] >= 5]  # Hardcoded!

# After  
auto_min_wins = st.sidebar.slider('Min Wins for Auto Suppression', ...)  # Configurable
auto_candidates = auto_candidates[auto_candidates['pair_wins_current'] >= auto_min_wins]
```

### Expected Results After Fix

With **auto_min_wins = 2** and **distributed_min_wins = 1**:

**2025-06-11:**
- Auto candidates (>= 2 wins): ~7 pairs (17 wins available)
- Should remove: ~10 wins from auto + distribution
- **Result: Full suppression** ✅

**2025-07-25 (huge spike: 148 wins):**
- Auto candidates (>= 2 wins): More coverage
- Distribution fills gaps
- **Result: Properly suppressed** ✅

## Lessons Learned

1. **One size doesn't fit all**: Large carriers (AT&T) have concentrated pairs (100+ wins). Small carriers (Windstream) have distributed pairs (1-5 wins). Hardcoded thresholds break one or the other.

2. **Always make thresholds configurable**: What works for analysis may not work for all carriers. Sliders give users control.

3. **Test with diverse carriers**: We tested with large carriers successfully, but Windstream revealed the edge case.

4. **National outliers can come from many small spikes**: Not just one big pair, but cumulative effect of dozens of small pairs.

## Validation Needed

Run these tests to confirm the fix works:

```bash
# 1. Set auto_min_wins = 2, distributed_min_wins = 1
# 2. Build plan for gamoshi non-mover, June 1 - August 31
# 3. Verify Windstream suppression:
#    - Should see ~437 total wins removed across 8 dates
#    - 2025-07-25 should remove ~148 wins
#    - 2025-07-26 should remove ~134 wins
#    - All national outliers should be addressed
```

## Additional Observations

### Pair-Level Outliers are Rare for Windstream

Even though national outliers exist, very few individual pairs have z-score > 1.5 at the DMA level. This is because:
- Volume is low per pair (1-5 wins)
- Variance is high (0-5 win range)
- Z-scores are computed per pair, not nationally

This reinforces the need for **distributed suppression** - it's the primary tool for carriers with many small markets.

### First Appearances are Common

Many pairs flagged as "first appearance" (appearance_rank <= 4), but with only 1-2 wins, they were filtered out by the 5-win threshold. Lowering to 2 captures these legitimately suspicious patterns.

## Recommendations

1. **Default thresholds**: Keep auto=2, distributed=1 as defaults
2. **Documentation**: Add tooltip explaining when to adjust (large vs small carriers)
3. **Monitoring**: After suppression, check if any national outliers remain unsuppressed - may indicate threshold is still too high
4. **Census block**: For surgical precision with small carriers, census-block level suppression would help (future enhancement)
