**Commit:** 79446c7

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

You asked three critical questions, and we've answered all of them with data-driven analysis:

### 1. How many new census blocks appear over time?

**Answer:** Consistently high volume of new appearances after baseline period

| Segment    | Avg New/Day | Median New/Day | Max Single Day | % of Combos That Are New | % of Volume from New |
|------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Movers     | **15,507**  | 14,150         | 42,576         | 60.47%                   | 60.04%               |
| Non-Movers | **5,497**   | 5,025          | 12,768         | 55.71%                   | 53.82%               |

**Key Insights:**
- New census block + carrier combinations appear daily
- High percentage (~60%) of daily activity is from new combinations
- Could indicate: market expansion, improved geocoding, seasonal patterns, or anomalies
- The census block + carrier space is large and sparse

### 2. How can we use census blocks for deterministic drill-down suppression?

**Answer:** Surgical precision vs. broad strokes

#### The Problem with Current Approach

**Current suppression level:**
```
(the_date, ds, mover_ind, dma, winner, loser)
```

**Problem:** Too coarse-grained. We suppress ALL records for the entire combination, throwing out good data with bad.

#### The Census Block Solution

**New suppression level:**
```
(the_date, ds, mover_ind, dma, census_block, winner, loser)
```

**Benefit:** Surgical removal of ONLY problematic census blocks while preserving legitimate data in the same DMA.

#### Real-World Results (2025-08-16)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total DMAs affected | 325 |
| Total census blocks | 14,524 |
| Unique blocks to suppress | 9,080 |
| **Overall data retention** | **37.48%** |
| Average retention per DMA | 26.62% |

**Los Angeles Example:**
- Total census blocks: 591
- Blocks to suppress: 275 (46.5%)
- **Data preserved: 316 blocks (53.47%)** ✅
- Old approach: Would suppress 100% (all 591 blocks) ❌

### 3. What are the recommended next steps?

#### Immediate Actions (This Sprint)

1. **Validate Suppression List**
   - Manually review top 100 flagged census blocks
   - Confirm suppression reasons make sense
   - Adjust thresholds: Z-score (3.0), spike ratio (5.0x), concentration (80%)

2. **Implement Surgical Suppression Pipeline**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE suppression_list (
       the_date DATE,
       ds VARCHAR,
       mover_ind BOOLEAN,
       state VARCHAR,
       dma_name VARCHAR,
       census_blockid VARCHAR,
       winner VARCHAR,
       loser VARCHAR,
       suppression_reasons VARCHAR,
       flagged_at TIMESTAMP,
       PRIMARY KEY (the_date, ds, mover_ind, census_blockid, winner, loser)
   );
   ```

3. **Test on Historical Data**
   - Compare old vs new approach on past dates
   - Measure data retention improvement
   - Verify outliers are successfully removed

4. **Measure Impact**
   - Calculate: `Retention Rate = (Total - Suppressed) / Total`
   - Show improvement: 37.5% vs 0% (old approach)

#### Medium-Term (Next Month)

5. **Automated Daily Suppression**
   - Run detection daily
   - Auto-populate `suppression_list` table
   - Send alerts for high-volume suppression days

6. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Add 'Data Quality' tab
   - Show daily suppression stats
   - Track trends over time

7. **Suppression Feedback Loop**
   - Manual override capability
   - Track false positives/negatives
   - Continuously improve thresholds

#### Long-Term (Next Quarter)

8. **Machine Learning for Suppression**
   - Train model on validated decisions
   - Features: historical patterns, carrier behavior, geography, DOW, seasonality
   - Predict suppression probability

9. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Investigate why certain carriers/DMAs have high suppression rates
   - Work with data providers to fix upstream issues
   - Reduce suppression needs over time

10. **Data Quality Scorecard**
    - Carrier-level quality scores
    - Use for contract negotiations
    - SLA enforcement

## 📊 Suppression Detection Methods

We flag census blocks for suppression using four methods:

1. **Statistical Outliers (DOW-Adjusted):** Values >3σ from same-day-of-week historical mean
   - Accounts for weekend vs weekday patterns
   - Prevents false positives from legitimate weekend spikes

2. **Volume Spikes:** Values >5x their 90-day rolling average
   - Detects dramatic sudden increases
   - Requires at least 3 historical observations

3. **Geographic Concentrations:** Blocks accounting for >80% of carrier's daily state activity
   - Flags suspicious clustering
   - May indicate geocoding errors or data aggregation issues

4. **First Appearances:** New census_block + winner + loser combinations never seen before
   - High-value first appearances warrant investigation
   - Could be legitimate expansion or anomalies

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### ✅ What Works

- **Surgical Precision:** 37.5% data retention vs 0% with old approach
- **Scalable:** Analysis runs in minutes on 4.7M census block records
- **Actionable:** Clear suppression list with specific census blocks to remove
- **Transparent:** Four distinct suppression reasons, easily auditable

### 🎯 Business Impact

**Old Approach:**
- Suppress entire DMA combinations
- Lose 100% of data for affected groups
- Overly aggressive, destroys good data

**New Approach:**
- Suppress only problematic census blocks
- Preserve 37.5% of data on average
- Surgical precision maintains product quality without sacrificing coverage

**Example Savings:**
- Los Angeles DMA: Save 316 legitimate census blocks (53% retained)
- Sacramento DMA: Save 97 blocks (57% retained)
- Nationwide: Save 5,444 census blocks out of 14,524 (37.5% retained)
