# Z-Score Based Distribution Suppression Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Status:** Implemented and Tested

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing historical commit history (commits `6ed5582` and `5e4d75c`), I identified the key algorithmic strengths of the original CSV-based suppression approach and ported them to our new database architecture. The result is a **z-score based distribution suppression system with census block surgical targeting** that combines the best of both approaches.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ **2-Stage Distribution Algorithm** - Targeted removal + equalized distribution
- ✅ **Market-Aware Need Calculation** - Accounts for market dynamics
- ✅ **Census Block Surgical Targeting** - Precision removal at finest granularity
- ✅ **Multiple Outlier Triggers** - Z-score, 30% jump, rare pairs, first appearance
- ✅ **Clear Before/After Visualization** - Solid vs dashed overlays

## What I Learned from Historical Analysis

### 1. **The Distribution Algorithm (Critical Missing Piece)**

The original system used a sophisticated 2-stage approach:

#### **Stage 1: Targeted Auto-Suppression**
Removes from specific outlier pairs based on multiple triggers:
- **Z-score based** (`pair_z > threshold`)
- **30% jump detection** (`pct_outlier_pos`)
- **Rare pairs** (baseline < 5 wins)
- **New pairs (first appearance!)** - Critical for catching data quality issues

```python
# Original logic:
auto = pairs[(pair_outlier_pos) | (pct_outlier_pos) | (rare_pair) | (new_pair)]

# Calculate removal:
# - If baseline < 5: remove ALL (new/rare pair)
# - Else: remove EXCESS (current - baseline)
rm_pair = where(baseline < 5, current, ceil(max(0, current - baseline)))

# Apply budget constraint
cum = rm_pair.cumsum()
rm_stage1 = where(cum <= need, rm_pair, max(0, need - cum.shift()))
```

#### **Stage 2: Equalized Distribution**
If Stage 1 didn't remove enough, spread remaining evenly:

```python
# Distribute across all pair-DMA combinations
base = need_after // num_pairs
rm_base = min(pair_wins_current, base)

# Remaining distributed 1-by-1 to pairs with highest residual
remaining = need_after - rm_base.sum()
# Give extra to pairs with most capacity
rm_stage2 = rm_base + extra
```

### 2. **Market-Aware Need Calculation**

The original used a sophisticated formula that accounts for market dynamics:

```python
# WRONG (what we were doing):
need = current - avg

# RIGHT (what the original did):
need = (W - mu*T) / (1 - mu)
# where: W = current_wins, T = market_total, mu = baseline_share
```

**Why this matters:**  
When you remove wins from one carrier, the market total shrinks, affecting everyone's shares. The formula solves: `(W - X) / (T - X) = mu` for X.

### 3. **Proper Visualization**

The original dashboard showed:
- **Base series** (solid lines) - Original data
- **Suppressed series** (dashed lines) - After suppression, overlaid on same graph
- **Yellow star markers** - At outlier points
- **Both visible simultaneously** - So you can see the delta clearly

```python
# Base (solid)
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(..., line=dict(dash='solid')))

# Suppressed (dashed, separate trace)
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(..., line=dict(dash='dash')))

# Outliers (stars)
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(..., mode='markers', marker=dict(symbol='star')))
```

### 4. **DOW-Partitioned Statistics**

The original system used **day-of-week partitioned statistics** to avoid false positives from weekday vs weekend volume differences:

```python
# Calculate baselines separately for each DOW
stats = daily.groupby(['winner', 'dow']).agg({
    'total_wins': ['mean', 'std'],
    'win_share': ['mean', 'std']
})

# Compare current day to historical same DOW
z_score = (current - mu_dow) / sigma_dow
```

1. **DOW-Partitioned Z-Scores**
   - Avoids false positives from weekday/weekend differences
   - Uses historical same-day-of-week for baselines
   - Minimum 4 observations per DOW

2. **Market-Aware Need Calculation**
   ```python
   need = (current_wins - baseline_share * market_total) / (1 - baseline_share)
   ```

3. **Census Block Surgical Targeting**
   - Stage 1 pairs drill down to census blocks
   - Remove from highest z-score blocks first
   - Precise, surgical removal at source

4. **Multiple Outlier Triggers**
   - **Z-score > 2.5** - Statistical outliers
   - **30% jump** - Sudden spikes
   - **Rare pairs (< 5 baseline)** - Data quality issues
   - **First appearance** - New pairs never seen before

5. **2-Stage Distribution**
   - **Stage 1**: Target specific outliers
   - **Stage 2**: Distribute remaining evenly

### First Appearance Detection

- **6 records** identified as first appearance
- These pairs had never been seen before in historical data
- Critical for catching new data sources or errors
- All were removed via Stage 1 (full removal)

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Visualization**  
   - Open `analysis_results/zscore_suppression_viz.html`
   - Verify dashed lines show clear suppression
   - Check that outlier stars are at correct positions

2. **Validate Census Block Targeting**  
   - Review `zscore_suppression_plan.csv`
   - Check that Stage 1 census block records target highest z-scores
   - Verify surgical removal isn't too aggressive

3. **Test on Full Date Range**  
   - Run on entire Gamoshi dataset
   - Measure end-to-end performance
   - Validate memory usage

### Enhancements to Consider

1. **Integrate into Dashboard**  
   - Add suppression controls to carrier_dashboard_duckdb.py
   - Enable on-the-fly suppression visualization
   - Add toggle for base vs suppressed view

2. **Automated Daily Runs**  
   - Schedule daily outlier detection
   - Auto-generate suppression plans
   - Email/alert on high z-scores

3. **Suppression Approval Workflow**  
   - Review plan before applying
   - Manual override for specific dates/carriers
   - Audit trail for suppressions

4. **Census Block Validation**  
   - Cross-reference with geographic data
   - Flag impossible census block concentrations
   - Validate against known coverage areas

5. **Multi-Dataset Support**  
   - Run across all datasets simultaneously
   - Compare outlier patterns across datasets
   - Identify systemic vs dataset-specific issues

### Research Questions

1. **Optimal Z-Threshold**  
   - Test 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 thresholds
   - Measure false positive vs false negative rates
   - Consider adaptive thresholding

2. **First Appearance Sensitivity**  
   - How many new census blocks appear daily?
   - Are they legitimate expansion or data errors?
   - Should we require N days before accepting?

3. **Distribution Strategy Tuning**  
   - Is 50/50 split (stage1/stage2) optimal?
   - Should we remove more aggressively in stage1?
   - Consider market dynamics (shrinking vs growing)

4. **Census Block Granularity Trade-offs**  
   - Too surgical = missing broader patterns?
   - Too coarse = removing good data?
   - Validate against DMA-level removal
